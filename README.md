# Problem Formulation

## Business Problem
Customer churn is a significant issue for businesses, leading to revenue loss. Acquiring new customers is expensive, so retaining existing customers is more cost-effective. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using data from multiple sources.

## Key Business Objectives
1. Build an automated pipeline to process customer data from multiple sources.
2. Predict customer churn using machine learning.
3. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Key Data Sources
The dataset consists of two data sources:
1. **Local Dataset**: A CSV file with customer records.
2. **Kaggle API Dataset**: Additional data fetched via the Kaggle API.

## Pipeline Outputs
1. Clean datasets for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    - Handle missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.
    - Standardize data formats and ensure correct types.
2. Transformed features for machine learning (e.g., customer tenure, total spend, activity frequency).
    - Encode categorical variables (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).
    - Normalize numerical features (MinMaxScaler).
    - Create new engineered features (e.g., customer tenure groups).
3. A deployable machine learning model to predict customer churn.
    - Train multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
    - Select the best-performing model for deployment.
    - Save the model using MLflow for versioning.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly predicted churn/non-churn cases.
- **Precision**: Percentage of correctly predicted churn cases out of all predicted churn cases.
- **Recall**: Percentage of correctly predicted churn cases out of all actual churn cases.
- **F1 Score**: A balance between precision and recall.
